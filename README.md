## Project Description

GitBuddy is a command line tool for simplifing the Git workflow.

Most IDEs come with a graphical Git integration for performing multiple steps (staging, commiting, pulling, pushing) in one operation (like "commit and push"). Imagine GitBuddy as a CLI version of that.

### Why are we interested in this project?

Students who are new to Git often find the workflow to be unintuitive, often forgetting steps like checking out to a freshly created branch.
A tool like GitBuddy would help reduce mistakes from new git users, and possible implementation of a "learning" or "tutorial" mode would allow users to gain confidence with Git.

### What languages/tools will we use?

- **C++**: All four group members have skill in C++ from CS010, so it is the language of choice. Python might be a better option on account of its memory safety, but its dynamic typing doesn't play well with large projects.
- **gtest**: Will be used to implement unit tests, especially for edge cases.
- **Git**: GitBuddy will invoke Git using the [`system()`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/system/) or `popen()` functions in the C standard library. Git will, of course, also be used to manage the project's versions.
- **GitHub**: Will host the Git repository for GitBuddy's source code.
- **valgrind**: Will be used to detect and debug memory errors. Fixing memory leaks will not be a significant priority since GitBuddy will not run in the background.

### Input/Output example

User interaction with GitBuddy will look something like this:

```
$ gb commit
Unstaged changes:
    main.cpp ++++--
    CMakeLists.txt ++++
    .gitignore +++-
Staged changes: none
Do you want to stage all changes? (Y/n): n
Select files to stage: (Some sort of terminal wizardry allows the user to choose what to stage)
Enter a commit message (leave blank to edit it in vim): Initial commit
Sync changes with remote? (Y/n): y
Apply changes? (Y/n): y
Done :)
```

In the above example, GitBuddy then runs `git add <selected files> && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git pull && git push`.

```
$ gb branch
Local branches:
    main
    mgheb003/project-proposal <- Current branch
Create or delete a branch? (C/d): c
Enter branch name: mgheb003/class-diagram
Checkout to the new branch? (Y/n): y
Apply changes? (Y/n): n
Canceled.
```

### Error handling

GitBuddy will handle git errors as gracefully as possible. For example:
- When attempting to push changes a branch that does not have an upstream, GitBuddy will ask the user if they want to create a branch on the remote.
- When encountering merge conflicts, GitBuddy will tell the user what files have conflicts. Once the conflicts have been resolved, the user can use GitBuddy to automatically finish the merge.
- If the user is not authenticated with GitHub, GitBuddy will provide them with instructions on how to authenticate.

### Features

Wizards will be implemented for the following Git workflows
- `commit`: Allows the user to select files to stage and enter a commit message.
- `merge`: Allows the user to select which branches to merge, then handles checking them out in the correct order and notifying the user of any merge conflicts. If a merge is in progress and all conflicts have been resolved when this command is invoked, GitBuddy will commit the merge.
- `branch`: Allows the user to create or delete a branch and asks if they want to checkout to that branch or not.
- `checkout`: Allows the user to choose a branch or commit to checkout to. If there are uncommited changes in the working directory, GitBuddy will ask the user if they want to stash their changes.
- `sync`: Will push and pull changes from the remote.
- `discard`: Allows the user to undo changes to files in the working directory.
- `revert`: Allows the user to select one or more commits to revert. If multiple commits are chosen, GitBuddy will then ask the user if they want to squash the revert commits.
- `reset`: Allows the user to roll history back to a commit of their choice.
- `ignore`: Allows users to untrack files of thier choosing and optionally add them to the gitignore.
- More features will be hashed out as development continues.

Other feature ideas
- GitBuddy will have a tool for configuring Git username and email, since the commands required for doing so are hard to remember.
- ~~A `gb tree` command could print out the repository's commit and branch history in a tree format.~~ It turns out that `git log --all --oneline --graph` can already do this. Maybe we can alias `gb tree` to that command?

A possible "tutorial mode" will show the user the sequence of commands that GitBuddy would run to make their request happen.

 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## User Interface Specification
 > Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from [this template](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~mgrass2/cmsc345/Template_UI.doc))

### Navigation Diagram

### Screen Layouts
> Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screenâ€™s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs, expected output, and buttons (if applicable). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.

## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
